## Overview
This project focuses on generating sales insights using data analysis techniques to help businesses make data-driven decisions. The project is designed for individuals aspiring to become data analysts or data scientists, offering hands-on experience in executing a real-world data analysis project similar to those in corporate environments.

The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of solving business problems using data analytics. Unlike conventional tutorials that only focus on using tools like Power BI or Tableau, this project emphasizes the entire workflow, from problem identification to solution implementation.

The project is broken down into multiple stages, covering:

- Understanding the business problem

- Data discovery and exploration

- Data cleaning and preprocessing

- Building insightful visualizations in Power BI

- Stakeholder feedback and iterative improvements

By the end of this project, a comprehensive Power BI dashboard will be created, providing actionable insights into sales performance. Additionally, participants will act as stakeholders to provide feedback, simulating real-world corporate interactions where data analysts refine their work based on user input.
